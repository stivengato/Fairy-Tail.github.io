                <h1>Fairy Tail</h1>
                <p>Fairy Tail is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima. It was serialized in
                 Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine from August 2006 to July 2017, with the individual chapters collected 
                 and published into 63 tankōbon volumes. The story follows the adventures of Natsu Dragneel, a member of the
                 popular wizard[a] guild Fairy Tail, as he searches the fictional world of Earth-land for the dragon Igneel.
                 The manga has been adapted into an anime series produced by A-1 Pictures, Dentsu Inc., Satelight, Bridge, and
                 CloverWorks which was broadcast in Japan on TV Tokyo from October 2009 to March 2013. A second series was broadcast
                 from April 2014 to March 2016. A third and final series was aired from October 2018 to September 2019.
                 The series has also inspired numerous spin-off manga, including a prequel by Mashima, Fairy Tail Zero,
                 and a sequel storyboarded by him, titled Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest. Additionally, A-1 Pictures has developed
                 nine original video animations and two animated feature films.
            
                 The manga series was originally licensed for an English release in North America by Del Rey Manga, which began
                 releasing the individual volumes in March 2008 and ended its licensing with the 12th volume release in September 2010.
                 In December 2010, Kodansha USA took over the North American release of the series. The Southeast Asian network 
                 Animax Asia aired an English-language version of the anime for seven seasons from 2010 to 2015. The manga was

                <h1>Production</h1>
                <p>After finishing his previous work, Rave Master, Hiro Mashima found the story sentimental and sad at the same time,
                 so he wanted the storyline of his next manga to have a "lot of fun."[4] His inspiration for the series was sitting
                 in bars and partying with his friends.[5] He also described the series as being about young people finding their calling,
                 such as a job.[5] Mashima drew a one-shot titled Fairy Tale that was published in Magazine Fresh on September 3, 2002,
                 which served as a pilot. Mashima's later concept for the serialized version involved Natsu as a fire-using member of a courier
                 guild who carries various things on assignments.[6] Mashima then came up with the idea to have different types of wizards hanging 
                 out in one place, and eventually coerced his editor into allowing him to change the concept to a wizard guild.[6]
                 The title was changed from "Tale" to "Tail" in reference to the tail of a fairy, which the author said may or may not prove to be a
                "pivotal point."[6] Mashima stated that while he tried to consider both his own interests and the fans' on what would happen next in Fairy Tail,
                 the fans' took precedence.[5]</p>

                in 2011.[17] A special issue of Weekly Shōnen Magazine, published on October 19, 2013, featured a small crossover between Fairy Tail
                and Nakaba Suzuki's The Seven Deadly Sins, where each artist drew a yonkoma (four-panel comic) of the other's series.
                [18] An actual crossover chapter between these two ran in the magazines' combined 4/5 issue of 2014, which was released on December 25, 2013.[19]
                A two-volume series called Fairy Tail S, which collects short stories by Mashima that were originally published in various Japanese magazines through the years,

After Del Rey Manga shut down,[23] Kodansha USA acquired the license and began publishing Fairy Tail volumes in May 2011.[24] They published the 63rd and final volume on January 23, 2018.[25] Kodansha USA began publishing a larger omnibus version of the series in November 2015. Called Fairy Tail: Master's Edition, each installment corresponds to five regular-sized volumes.[26] They published the first volume of Fairy Tail S: Tales from Fairy Tail on October 24, 2017.[27]

                The manga has also been licensed in other English-speaking countries. In the United Kingdom, the volumes are distributed by Turnaround Publisher Services.[28]

                <p>Natsu, the main character, is a mage raised by a dragon named Igneel Dragneel who disappeared
                 in the year 777, only to appear from within Natsu some time later. Looking for Igneel, he joins
                 the Fairy Tail guild, within which the whole adventure takes place in the company of other magicians.
                 Natsu's magic is Fire-type, Dragon Slayer style (dragon slayer). His greatest weakness is means of 
                 transportation of any kind, as he gets seasick during a trip, except those that are in his animal friends,
                 for which he complains when Lucy mentions why he is not seasick when he flies. with Happy.</p>

                <p>Lucy is a cheerful girl and a star mage, who through Star Keys (which can be gold, silver or bronze)
                can summon the Star Spirits. Despite her superficial attitude, she is a very kind girl who loves
                Fairy Tail and her companions. She is passionate about reading, and is in the process of writing her
                own novel. She was a member of the Heartfilia family, one of the richest and most influential families
                in the Kingdom of Fiore. However, due to her estranged relationship with her father and the death of her
                mother, she left her home to follow her own path. She often changes her clothes, which is why Bixlow
                 nicknames her "the cosplay girl". Lucy's greatest wish was always to enter Fairy Tail.</p>

                <p>She is a tall girl with long hair and brown eyes. Her last name, Scarlet, was given to her by Jellal
                 when they were children, because of her scarlet hair. She is always dressed in armor, made by Heart Kreuz.
                 Her Fairy Tail emblem is located on her left arm and is blue in color. She uses re-equip magic, but she is
                 the only one who can re-equip her weapons and armor on her. Her magical specialty is to fight at close range 
                 with her equipment and win in just a moment.</p>

                <p>ray uses the magic of "Ice Make" and the "Ice Devil Slayer". Gray can only create non-living objects
                 unlike Lyon Bastia, his partner and childhood magic apprentice. His parents died because of a beast called Deliora,
                 so Gray tried to take revenge, but before he took magic classes with Ur, his teacher. Halfway through his training,
                 he learned that Deliora was coming to the city, so he argued with Ur and went out to fight the beast himself. 
                 He couldn't achieve his goal, so Ur had to rescue him, sacrificing his life using magic he discovered in a book 
                (he transformed his body into water to perform freezing).</p>
